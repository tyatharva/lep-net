Fork of pix2pix (https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix)
Modified to have a UNetFormer generator (https://github.com/WangLibo1995/GeoSeg/blob/main/geoseg/models/UNetFormer.py)
Subset of data is availble here (entire dataset is 169 GB but code to get data is in here)
1 example case for Lake Ontario is given
You need to unzip the archive in the pix2pix folder to get the data
